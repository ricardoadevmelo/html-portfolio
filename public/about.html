  About Me:
</h1>
<hr />
<p>
  My name is Ricardo Alves Melo. I was born in Brasilia, the capital of Brazil. <br />
  I live in the northeast of Brazil, the state of Piaui, at the moment, in the city of Parnaiba.<br />
  I'm studying web development and looking for a career transition.<br />
  I worked as a seller, representative, lawyer, but more than seven years ago, I work remotely in public service, as an
  advisor to judge in the court of
  law in my state.

  I'm divorced, I don't have children and I live alone. When I'm with my family, we usually stay together at home,
  because we live far from each other. We like to go to the pizzeria, visit the historic center or the beaches of my
  city.<br />
  I practice bodybuilding and beach tennis. But I like extreme sports like abseiling, sandboarding, snowboarding and
  surfing.<br />
  When I'm not working or studying, I like computer games, the gym, the beach, restaurants, bars, the historic center
  and I love to travel.
  I traveled to countries like Norway, Sweden, France and Netherlands.<br />
